This is a demo [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses `react-use-draggable-scroll`.

## Getting Started

This project should run automatically.

In case it doesn't, here are the steps:

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Troubleshooting

If you see a white screen after the project is running, refresh the container on the right.
